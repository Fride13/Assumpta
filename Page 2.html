        After acquiring that success in my Ordinary level results, i entered <strong>HIGH SCHOOL</strong> thinking <br>
        thinking i would have been resting, Ironiacally ,i had to change my study routine as compared to secondary school <br>.
    Being a Lower Sixths student, i had to make sure that i cover all topics concernig Advaced Levels, so as <br>
to meet upm in <em>Upper Sixths</em> then, i followed my reading time table ,hence succeeded in my <strong>ADVANCED LEVEL</strong>
results. I passed all my four papers in flying colours.</p>
