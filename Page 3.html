        Graduating from high shool has been the most exciting experience i had ever had ,though it came with its own <br>
        troubles as i forged ahead. Since childhood, i had always aspired being a reknowed <strong>LAWYER</strong>. <br>
        So i went to study Law in the <strong>UNIVERSITY OF BUEA</strong> in my first year. It was a wonderful experience <br>
        not until i realised that ,the world evolves in <em>TECHNOLOGY</em> as time goes by, so, finished my first year <br>
        there,and te following year i decided to get enrolled in an <strong>ENGINEERING SCHOOL</strong> to build my skills <br>
        in the <em>TECH FIELD</em> and striving in becoming a <strong>NETWORKING EXPERT</strong> without exempting my passion <br>
        in make-up, because i would equally love to be a make-up artist.Life has not been totally fair as a student <br>
        but i endeavour learn anything that would make me partial jack of all trades.
